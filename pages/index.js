                  <p><strong>VORP: Value Over Replacement Player</strong><br />
                  <em>Def: <strong>A single-number measure of a player&apos;s value, specific to that players&apos; position, and your league settings</strong></em>.</p>
                  <p>The stat was first used in the MLB [of course] as a way to measure the effective value of pitcher [<em>e.g.:&quot;How many runs would a replacement level pitcher have allowed here?&quot;</em>].</p>
                  <p>In Fantasy Sports, though, there are far less variables to consider, and far more structure. This makes VORP is a <em>much</em> more effective and simple way of measuring player values in Fantasy. However, for some reason VORP hasn&apos;t been adopted by any of the major fantasy platforms - currently, VORP is only really used within some custom spreadsheets found online which may be difficult to find and/or use...</p>

                  <p className="logoFont">Q: Why is VORP better?</p>
                  <p><strong>Using VORP is better than your fantasy platform&apos;s existing pre-season / in-season rankings</strong>.</p>
                  <p>The standard fantasy platform rankings are not great - and most fantasy GMs know this. That&apos;s why there is an entire cottage industry of <em>custom spreadsheets</em> and <em>insider projections</em>, and so on. Don&apos;t get me wrong - these analysts and spreadsheets are undoubtedly very valuable... for users that want to spend the time and effort to find the right analyst/tool and customize their spreadsheet to perfection.</p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>But what if we could just use the existing raw stats to create a better ranking system? </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>The facts of the case:</p>
                  <ul className="withDots">
                    <li>
                      Standard fantasy platform pre-season rankings are not great. Even the platforms themselves know this - their business is competently facilitating a fantasy league, not performing complex calculations to provide you custom data insights.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This lack of effort into data extends to the Regular Season, too, of course. In-season rankings are usually calculated with the most simple possible calculation [averages of each category]. This process works to provide rough estimates of overall value, but <strong>doesn&apos;t take into account several important factors in fantasy</strong>, such as: the value of a category within that players&apos; position, the value of that position relative to other positions, the scarcity of that position&apos;s value, and so much more.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Using VORP solves all of these issues - without increasing complexity. It&apos;s 1 number, and a better ranking.</strong></p>
                  <p>You can go as deep as you&apos;d like into the complexity, of course, as well. You can calculate VORP within each category, and even VORP within each category within each position ðŸ¤¯. But we&apos;re trying to SAVE time and effort here, though, right? So let&apos;s keep it simple - <strong>in fantasy sports, your primary goal is to better understand player values, and VORP makes that easier.</strong> <em>VORP is better</em>.</p>

              Category VORPs may not sum to overall VORP or positional VORP. This is because each VORP is a silo - only compared to relevant comparators, and finally adjusted to replacement levels.
